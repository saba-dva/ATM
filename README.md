## About

The **ATM** project is a simulation of an ATM system built in Java. 
Users can log in using an account ID + PIN (or password), then perform simple transactions like checking their balance, depositing funds, or withdrawing cash.
This project is intended for learning purposes—understanding user authentication, simple account management, transaction logic, and exception handling in Java.
